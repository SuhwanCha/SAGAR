כֹּה־  אָמַ֣ר  יְהוָה֮  לִמְשִׁיחֹו֮  לְכֹ֣ורֶשׁ  אֲשֶׁר־  הֶחֱזַ֣קְתִּי  בִֽימִינֹ֗ו  לְרַד־  לְפָנָיו֙  גֹּויִ֔ם  וּמָתְנֵ֥י  מְלָכִ֖ים  אֲפַתֵּ֑חַ  לִפְתֹּ֤חַ  לְפָנָיו֙  דְּלָתַ֔יִם  וּשְׁעָרִ֖ים  לֹ֥א  יִ**סָּגֵֽרוּ׃**

This is what the Lord says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor, to open doors before him so that gates **will not be shut**:

- Isaiah 45:1
